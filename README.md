This flag serves as a symbol representing the process of forging an alliance between the two kingdoms. However, if neither of the children belongs to you, the red flag will not be raised, and the alliance process will not start. Both children will be removed from the lists as they become a family unit and their cards will disappear from the screen.<br>
